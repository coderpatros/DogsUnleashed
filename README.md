# DogsUnleashed
Sunshine Coast Dog Off Leash Areas

One of the ideas that came out of a previous Sunshine Coast Council HackFest was Dogs Unleashed.

An app that would tell you where you could exercise your dog, off leash, combined with other 
information like dog watering bowls and beach access points.

This is a basic example implementation of the Dogs Unleashed idea. It still needs some work. But it
demonstrates a number of key bits of functionality, including displaying multiple SCC GIS layers on a map.

It's licenced under the MIT licence, so feel free to use it as a starting point for your project/prototype.
